Object Settings
===============

.. _user-feature-object:

This section will take you through the base settings required for your model.

.. add something more here
.. May break up the common by type; armature, mesh, common etc?


BSX
---
.. _user-feature-object-bsx:

**BSX** is a flagging variable that determines how havok will interact with the object:

+-----------------------+-------+
| Setting               | Value |
+=======================+=======+
| Havok                 | 1     |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Collision             | 2     |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Is armiture (?)       | 4     |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Enable Animation      | 8     |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Flame Nodes           | 16    |
+-----------------------+-------+
| Editor marker present | 32    |
+-----------------------+-------+

*Example:*
   To enable havok and collision the value would be 3.

.. note::
   The value is equal to the sum of all items that are enabled.
   
.. _user-feature-object-mesh-bsinvmarker:

BS Inventory Marker
-------------------

*BS Inv Marker** sets the x, y, z rotation and zoom level of objects for the in-game inventory display in games that
*support the property.

#. With Blender in Object mode, open the BS Inv Marker property window and click "**+**".
   
.. note::
   This should only be applied to the Root object.
   
   For rigged meshed this should be applied to the armature.
   For non-rigged objects it should be applied to the Mesh object.

2. Apply desired values to x, y, z to set the preferred rotation.

   a. Set view to back view (i.e. from positive Y-axis) 
   #. Set the rotation of the root node to ZYX and use rotation to achieve the preferred object orientation.
   #. Copy the values from the rotation display into the x, y, z lines for BS Inv Marker.
   #. Press ``Alt + R`` to reset the object rotation back to 0
   
   Due to the way this is stored in the nif format (integers rather than floats), repeated import and export may lead
   to some deviation from the origina value. However, this should be minor.

#. Apply desired value to zoom   

   a. A value of ``1`` for zoom is the default, lower values ``.99`` to ``.01`` decrease the item size in the menu.
      
.. note::
   Rigged objects that use this value may also use :ref:`InvMarker Bones <armature-invmarker>`.

.. _object-mesh-upb:

UPB
---

The **UPB** is a group of values contained in a single data string. Its use is unknown at this time.

Niftools uses the following values as default for this item:

+---------------------+----------+
| Setting             | Value    |
+=====================+==========+
| Mass                | 0.000000 |
+---------------------+----------+
| Elasticity          | 0.300000 |
+---------------------+----------+
| Friction            | 0.300000 |
+---------------------+----------+
| Unyielding          | 0        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Simulation_Geometry | 2        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Proxy_Geometry      | <None>   |
+---------------------+----------+
| Use_Display_Proxy   | 0        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Display_Children    | 1        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Disable_Collisions  | 0        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Inactive            | 0        |
+---------------------+----------+
| Display_Proxy       | <None>   |
+---------------------+----------+

Settings
--------
.. _user-feature-object-settings:

First, we complete the object panel:

#. The **Nif Root Node** determines the kind of block used at the nif's root.

   Select one from the drop-down box.

#. The Weapon Location determines where on the body the object is equipped, for Oblivion, Fallout 3 or Skyrim. Set it
   to an appropriate setting, or leave to NONE if not applicable. Not every game has specialised values for every
   setting. For example, Fallout 3 does not have slots for a bow.
#. The **UPB**'s use is currently unknown. It is recommended you leave it at the default value.
#. Set your **BSX Flags**.
#. Select a **Consistency Flag** from the drop-down box. See `this comment
   <https://github.com/niftools/nifskope/issues/69#issuecomment-61427385>`_ for discussion of what they might do.
#. The **Object Flag** corresponds to the flags field on NiAVObjects. The exact meaning will differ based on the block type. Set it to an appropriate number. If left to 0, will use a default value.
#. The **Nif Long Name** is the actual name used for the corresponding block in the nif. You can either set it to an appropriate string, or leave it empty. In the latter case, the nif name will be determined based on the blender name of the object.
#. The **Skeleton Root** determines the root bone used in this mesh's SkinInstance. Can usually be ignored / left empty, falls back to the armature object = root node.

.. Extra Data and InvMarkers I have no idea how to fill them in. Help?

Node Types
----------

Blender empties can represent various NIF node types, and are selected according to the following criteria:

* In the 'Object Constraints Panel', add a 'Track To' object constraint to create a 'NiBillboardNode' that always faces
  the camera.
* Add a custom property to create a 'NiLODNode'. Set Near extent and far extent as properties on the Lod controller's
  children.
* Select the root node type from the dropdown menu.
